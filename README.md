### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub account! I'm currently into PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) fullstack app development using TypeScript/JavaScript.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a demo project called [Favorite Map Locations](https://github.com/jason102/fav-map-locations/tree/feature/code-for-review), which allows users to save places on the map, upload photos, rate, and leave/respond to comments per place.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a new job! Can I join your company? Please find my CV/resume in the Featured section on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstine/).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to the PERN stack or JavaScript/TypeScript: I love discussing it and have been a mentor!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I developed and published my own React Native app on the app stores called LingoMap, a China map app for foreigners who cannot read Chinese, essentially a translation of Alibaba Maps that shows places/directions in Chinese, English, and Mandarin pinyin for pronunciation. This app has been promoted to and downloaded by thousands of users and established an enthusiastic user and fan base.
